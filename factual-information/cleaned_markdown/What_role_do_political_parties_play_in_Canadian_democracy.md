## What role do political parties play in Canadian democracy?

A political party is a group of members who share similar beliefs and values who try to win elections and influence policy decisions. Understanding the role political parties play and how they are governed is key to civic literacy. Voters should make informed decisions at the ballot box by learning where the parties stand on civic issues such as health care, education, and the environment. Learning how to have political conversations and sharing ideas about political ideas and events is also an important civic literacy tool. A civil society relies on being informed, having civil conversations, respecting differences, and sharing ideas.
