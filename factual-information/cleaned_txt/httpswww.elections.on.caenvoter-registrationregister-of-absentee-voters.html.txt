# Register of Absentee Voters

Register of Absentee Voters is only for eligible provincial electors temporarily living outside of Ontario who intend to return to Ontario. As an absentee voter, you are eligible to vote in an Ontario provincial election for up to two years from the date you leave Ontario.

Being on the Register of Absentee Voters does not necessarily make you eligible to vote in local elections as a non-resident.

[Search the Register of Absentee Voters](https://vreg.registertovoteon.ca/ "Opens in a new tab") to confirm, update or add your voter information. You will need to provide [ID and/or other required documentation](https://www.registertovoteon.ca/register-of-absentee-voters/id-documentation-to-register-as-an-absentee-voter "Opens in the same tab").
