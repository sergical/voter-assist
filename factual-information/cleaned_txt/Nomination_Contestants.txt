# Nomination Contestants

A nomination contestant is a person seeking endorsement from a registered political party as an official party candidate in an electoral district. Political parties and constituency associations hold nomination contests to choose their candidate for an election.

Internal party contest rules and contest fees are not regulated by Elections Ontario.

The nomination contest period, with respect to a nomination contestant, is the period that begins when the contestant first receives or spends funds for the purpose of achieving the endorsement, and ends three months after the candidate for the electoral district is selected.

### Register a nomination contest and contestant

The registered political party or constituency association that wants to hold a nomination contest must inform us of the date of the official call of the nomination contest and of the date fixed for the vote. This is done by filing a [Form NC-2 Notice of Nomination Contest](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/politicalentities/NC-2%20Notice%20of%20Nomination%20Contest.pdf).

If you actively engage in a nomination contest must register with us as a nomination contestant as soon as the registered political party advises us a contest is taking place.

Before registering you must appoint a chief financial officer. Nomination contestants register with us by completing a [Form NC-1 Nomination Contestant Registration and Change Notice](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/politicalentities/NC-1%20Nomination%20Contestant%20Registration%20and%20Change%20Notice%20Form.pdf). There is no fee to register as a nomination contestant.

If you have won a nomination contest, please note that you will not be considered a candidate until you submit your [Candidate Nomination Paper (F0400)](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/politicalentities/F0400%20-%20Candidate%20Nomination%20Paper.pdf).

For a full list of rules, a chief financial officer's roles and responsibilities and complete details please see the [CFO Handbook for Nomination Contestants](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/Compliance%20Documentation/English/nomination-contestants/CFO%20Handbook%20for%20Nomination%20Contestants.pdf).
