# Constituency Associations

A constituency association, sometimes known as a riding association, is an organization formed in an electoral district to support a political party or an independent member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

Provincial constituency associations in Ontario must follow the rules as outlined in the [*Election Finances Act*](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e07). All constituency associations in Ontario must be registered with Elections Ontario.

**How to Register or De-register Constituency Associations?**

Constituency associations in Ontario must be registered with Elections Ontario. By registering, a constituency association is able to receive contributions and issue tax receipts, finance its political activities, and endorse candidates.

When you fill out forms, ensure:

- All information is accurate and complete.
- Information is typed or printed clearly on the form.

**Register a Constituency Association**

To register a constituency association, do the following:

1. Complete and sign [Form A-1: Constituency Association Registration and Change Notice](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/Compliance%20Documentation/English/Constituency%20Associations/Form%20A-1%20Constituency%20Association%20Registration%20and%20Change%20Notice.pdf).
2. Obtain endorsement from your political party or your independent member on the Form A-1.

**De-registration of a Constituency Association**

There are two ways that a constituency association can be de-registered:

**Voluntary de-registration:**
If you wish to voluntarily de-register a constituency association, you need to [send a written request to Elections Ontario](https://www.elections.on.ca/en/contact-us/contact-information-by-department.html#accordioncontactef).
