Elections Ontario is responsible for maintaining the Permanent Register of Electors for Ontario, commonly known as the Register, based on updates by electors and from federal, provincial and municipal sources.

The Register is a list of individuals eligible to vote in provincial, municipal, district social services administration board and school board elections in Ontario. Eligibility requirements are different for provincial and local elections.

Elections Ontario administers provincial general elections and by-elections in Ontario.

Local elections include municipal, district social services administration board (DSSAB) and school board elections in Ontario. Local elections are not administered by Elections Ontario. They continue to be the responsibility of municipal clerks, DSSABs and some school boards.
