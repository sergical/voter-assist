# Candidate Search

**A provincial general election has been called.** **Election
day** is February 27.

**Why can't I find the candidate I'm looking for?**

Candidate nominations close at 2 PM (Eastern Time) on February 13. 

**I don't know my Electoral District. What do I do so I can find my local candidates?**

You can find your Electoral District by entering your postal code into [Voter Information Service](https://voterinformationservice.elections.on.ca/en/election/search?mode=postalCode).
Once you have located your electoral district, there is a link to all
registered candidates on the page.

**Why do some candidates have links to their websites and others do not?**

Candidates do not have to provide a website to Elections Ontario. We
provide links to candidate websites only if they are provided by the
candidate.

Elections Ontario is not responsible for, and does not endorse, content
posted on external websites.
