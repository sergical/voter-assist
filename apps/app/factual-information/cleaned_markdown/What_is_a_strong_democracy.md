# What is a strong democracy?

While democracy is an established form of government with a long history, it is never a guarantee. Citizens have a duty and responsibility to strengthen democracy and  keep it healthy, as do elected governments not only in Canada but around the world. In the 21st century, new forms of media have  presented both benefits and challenges for democracies. 

Digital/social media platforms can spread misinformation and disinformation that weakens democracy and undermines democratic institutions. However, they can also present opportunities for citizens with similar and differing beliefs and values to engage with one another, the government, and other institutions more easily. It is important for people to engage in civic action, know their rights, and understand their responsibilities of citizenship in order to keep democracy strong and healthy.

## Curriculum connections

- A1. Political Inquiry: Use the political inquiry process and the concepts of political thinking when investigating issues, events, and developments of civic importance.
- A1.2 Select and organize relevant evidence, data, and information on issues, events, and/or developments of civic importance from a variety of primary and secondary sources, including media forms such as social and traditional medias, ensuring that their sources reflect multiple perspectives 
- B3. Rights and Responsibilities: Analyse key rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship, in both the Canadian and global context, and some ways in which these rights are protected or may be infringed upon 
- B3.2 Analyse key responsibilities associated with Canadian citizenship
- B3.5 Analyse rights and responsibilities of citizenship within a global context, including those related to international conventions, laws, and/or institutions

## Learning goals

- Identify signs that a democracy is healthy and strong or weak and distressed
- Identify examples of democracy in action in Canada

## Success criteria

- Explain the characteristics of a strong and healthy democracy
- Explain the characteristics of a weak or distressed democracy
- Use media sources, including social media, to locate examples of democracy in action and label those actions as examples of strong/healthy or weak/distressed

## Inquiry question

- What is a strong democracy?

## Minds on

- Review the principles of democracy to refresh student memory.
- Discuss how each principle is necessary for a democracy to be healthy and strong.
- Make a list together of words or phrases associated with a strong democracy and then a list of words and phrases associated with a weak democracy.
- Tell students they will consider events from democracies around the world as well as in Canada and place them on a scale from Healthy/Strong to Weak/Distressed. This can be done individually or in groups.
- In their partners or small groups, students should locate a news story that provides an example of democracy being strengthened or weakened. They should gain a basic understanding of an event and determine where it should be placed on the scale from Healthy/Strong to Weak/Distressed. They will write the name of the event on the scale once they have made their decisions.
- Discuss student placement on the rating scale after they have finished the task. Encourage students to share their events and ratings with an explanation. Come to a class consensus on where each event should be placed as much as is possible and keep the class copy in a visible location for the remainder of the lesson.
- Add to the class list of words/phrases associated with strong/healthy and weak/distressed democracies now that students have been exposed to the case studies. Students can add these words along the top and bottom of their rating scales.

## Activity

- Distribute copies of the Democracy in action handout to students. They should work in partners or small groups, but this activity can also be completed individually.
- Students will use print and/or online news sources, including social media, to find examples of the principles of democracy in action -- these can be examples of the principle being practiced in a strong and healthy way or examples in which the democratic principle is weak and distressed. 
- Ask each student or small group to present one news story to the class and connect it to one of the principles of democracy, explaining whether it shows a strong/healthy democracy or one that is weak/distressed.

## Consolidation

**Four corners**

To check for students' understanding of the principles of democracy and how they can be strengthened or challenged, use the four corners of the room as designated areas. The areas are: Strongly Agree, Somewhat Agree, Somewhat Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Students go to the corner that matches their choice regarding the statement and discuss.

Here are some examples of statements. 

- Canadian democracy is strong and healthy.
- Democracies around the world will continue to be democracies forever.
- A healthy democracy means people vote.
- I have a role to play in keeping democracy strong and healthy.
- Weak and distressed democracies cannot be saved.
- Democracies around the world have a responsibility to help other democracies stay healthy.
- I can recognize the signs of a weak or distressed democracy.

## Assessment

- The Four Corners assessment allows teachers to gather observational and conversational assessment information by engaging students with questions that delve deeper into the student learning.
- An exit card or quick write can follow responding to the lesson's inquiry question ("What is a strong democracy?") to provide more assessment information on student learning.
