# How do the principles of democracy apply to my life?

Canada is a nation of many peoples, languages, regions, and perspectives. Democracy in Canada has a long history, stretching back to Indigenous talking circles in North America. Democracy is not static; it continues to evolve and includes dark moments where the principles of democracy were not extended to certain groups throughout history. Democracy is practised through the structures and processes of our governments but also in how Canadians live their everyday lives. It is not a guarantee; democracy can be challenged and weakened. However, it can also be strengthened and improved. It is important that all Canadians are equal participants in Canadian democracy and understand what that means.

## Learning goals

I am learning to:

-   identify the foundational ideas of democracy
-   identify the principles of democracy in the Constitution of Canada and the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, as well as the Ontario Human Rights Code
-   apply the principles of democracy to my daily life

## Success criteria

I can:

-   explain what democracy means to me
-   provide evidence of the principles of democracy in the Constitution of Canada and the *Charter*, as well as the Ontario Human Rights Code
-   analyze to what degree my school puts the principles of democracy into practice

## Inquiry question

How do the principles of democracy apply to my life?

## Minds on

1\. Organize students into partners or small groups. Tell them today's lesson is about the principles of democracy. Post the definition of "principle" in a visible spot in the class.

a\. a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.

2\. In their partnerships or small groups, students will discuss what they think the fundamental beliefs are that provide the foundation for a democracy. In other words, what are the core foundational ideas that democracy is built on? You can warm students up by having them suggest words or phrases that they think of when they hear the word democracy. Some examples students might suggest are:

a\. Human rights

b\. Freedoms

c\. Elections

d\. Government is limited

e\. Accountability

f\. Equality

g\. Minorities are protected

h\. Majority rules

3\. Students should record their thinking on sticky notes or chart paper to capture what they think forms the foundation of democracy.

4\. Explain that each group will create a bumper sticker that reflects some key aspect or big idea that is a principle of democracy. Provide 8-10 minutes to create the bumper sticker. Provide pieces of paper cut into the shape of a bumper sticker to students. If students need inspiration, do a quick Google search for funny or clever bumper stickers. Encourage students to illustrate and add a design to their bumper stickers if they have time.

5\. After the designated time, ask each group to choose a speaker to share its bumper sticker. Here are some examples students could come up with:

a\. Gov't works 4 u

b\. Fundamental Rights & Equality Everywhere (F.R.E.E)

c\. I brake for human rights

d\. Equality rocks my socks off

6\. Post the bumper stickers in a visible spot for the remainder of the lesson.

## Activity

1\. Provide students with the fact sheets on the [Constitution of Canada](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20A%20-%20Fact%20sheet%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Canada.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the *[Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20A%20-%20Fact%20sheet%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Canada.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"}*, and the [Ontario Human Rights
Code](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20A%20-%20Fact%20sheet%20The%20Constitution%20of%20Canada.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Appendix A). The teacher may wish to divide
the class into separate groups focusing on one of the documents and then
sharing their findings or creating groups of students looking at all the
documents together or designating one person to each document and then
sharing in small groups (groups of three).

2\. Using the handout, [Principles of Canadian
democracy](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20B%20-%20Student%20handout%20The%20principles%20of%20Canadian%20democracy.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Appendix B), each small group will consider
what values and principles are evident in the documents they are
assigned.

3\. Discuss as a class what principles are clear in the documents that
form the foundation of Canadian democracy. Encourage students to provide
evidence from the documents. A teacher key has been provided.

4\. Review the principles of democracy using the [slide
deck](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/Principles%20of%20Democracy.pptx "Downloads")
provided. Students can add to their handouts any principles the class
did not identify and try to find evidence in the documents.

## Consolidation

1\. Students can work in teams or individually on the [Democracy Report
Card](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20D%20-%20Student%20handout%20Democracy%20report%20card.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} handout (Appendix D). Remind students to not
just look for how the principles are put into practice in their school
environment but also the challenges in doing so. Students should
consider:

a\. Student Council/Student Government

b\. Parent Council

c\. Student Trustees

d\. Trustees

e\. Classroom and School Policies

***Teacher Note:** This can be as intensive as the teacher wishes to
encourage. Students can use the school agenda book, school website,
school newsletters, board website and even news articles about the
school board as sources. They can also ask questions of school
administrators, teachers and officials to help them make their
evaluation.*

2\. Distribute a copy of the [Exit
card](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20E%20-%20Student%20handout%20Assessment%20Exit%20card.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Appendix E) -- Is democracy healthy and
strong at your school?

a\. Students assess to what degree their school puts the principles of
democracy into practice.

b\. Students give their school a final rating based on their analysis.

## Assessment

1\. The teacher can use the [Democracy report
card](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20D%20-%20Student%20handout%20Democracy%20report%20card.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} handout to assess student learning. Concepts
that seem challenging for students can be addressed in the next class or
lesson. The teacher can also use student work to create an exemplar
featuring strong examples of their responses for all students to review.

2\. The teacher can use the [Exit
card](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-10-english/1/Appendix%20E%20-%20Student%20handout%20Assessment%20Exit%20card.pdf "Opens in a new tab"){target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"} as an assessment of learning.
