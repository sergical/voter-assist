# Election Official Employment Centre

The total number of hours worked for Elections Ontario in a calendar year determines if CPP and EI should be deducted. Once you have worked 35 hours for Elections Ontario in a year, CPP and EI start to be deducted, beginning with the first hour worked. Income tax is deducted based on bi-weekly tax tables supplied by the Canada Revenue Agency.

As per Canada Revenue Agency guidelines, T4s will be mailed to the provided address no later than the last day of February of the following year.

Records of Employment will be issued only if you have worked at least 35 hours and had Employment Insurance deducted from your pay. Elections Ontario submits Records of Employment electronically to Service Canada. You can access your Record of Employment through Service Canada.
