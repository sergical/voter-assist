# What makes a good political decision in a democracy?

Ontario is divided into 124 electoral districts (EDs). Each ED is represented by one Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

Making good political decisions is an important part of Ontario's democratic process. When these decisions are made, some people may be happy and others disappointed or frustrated. However, that is what democracy is about: everyone has the right to vote for their representative in an electoral district. The candidate that then represents that electoral district must work hard to make decisions that represent the majority of the electors.

## Inquiry question

What makes a good political decision in a democracy?

## Minds on

1. Organize students into small groups or partners. Provide each group
with a copy of the [Map of Ontario's electoral
districts](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20A%20-%20Student%20handout%20Map%20of%20Ontario%E2%80%99s%20electoral%20districts.pdf "Opens in a new tab") as well as the handout, [I see,
I think, I
wonder](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20B%20-%20Student%20handout%20I%20see%20I%20think%20I%20wonder.pdf "Opens in a new tab"). This is a thinking protocol that helps set the stage for inquiry and emphasizes the importance of observation as the basis for thinking. This is a great thinking tool to use at the start of a new lesson or unit.

***Teacher Tip:** A sample [completed
handout](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20C%20-%20Teacher%20key%20I%20see%20I%20think%20I%20wonder.pdf "Opens in a new tab") is provided in the learning materials for this lesson as a guide. *

2. Provide a brief explanation to students about the map: Ontario is
currently divided into 124 electoral districts. An electoral district
(ED) is a geographical area of the province, defined by law, and is
represented by a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the
Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Each ED is represented by one MPP so
that is why there are 124 MPPs at Queen's Park in Ontario.

3. Allow time for students to make their observations and wonderings.
Some question prompts the teacher can use are:

a. Are all the EDs the same size?

b. Do they all have the same climate?

c. What do you notice about the concentration or amount of EDs in the
different areas of Ontario?

d. Do you notice any difference between the north and south of Ontario?

e. What physical characteristics of the land are unique to some of the
EDs?

f. Would all the people living in the EDs be similar? Different
languages and cultural groups?

4. Have students rotate groups or provide a space for students to post
their wonderings so that students can share ideas.

5. Conduct a brief whole group discussion about the differences and
similarities between Ontario's electoral districts, emphasizing how many
there are, the different people and groups they represent, and how the
political representatives are responsible for meeting the needs of the
whole province. Would this be easy or hard? Why?

elections are organized in Canada provides students with background
information on the different levels of government and their relevant
terminology and processes. This Elections Ontario video, [Which
Election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCGOYsXOxyY&feature=youtu.be "Opens in a new tab"), also provides relevant information for
students.

## Activity

1. If students completed lesson 1 from Elections Ontario's Grade 5
curriculum resources, [What is
democracy](https://www.elections.on.ca/en/resource-centre/educational-resources/curriculum-resources/grade-5/what-is-democracy-.html "Opens in the same tab"),
they may remember that Ontario is a representative democracy and that a
key characteristic of democracy is the common good. It is important that
political representatives make good political decisions.

2. In their groups from the Minds On, ask students to brainstorm what
they think constitutes a good political decision. How would you know if
the government is making a good decision? Give students chart paper,
sticky notes, or a digital brainstorming tool to record their thinking.
These can be short phrases (e.g. common good, everyone is happy), single
words

(e.g. fair, well-researched, smart) or sentences (e.g. makes good
financial sense, there were many voices heard, a lot of people will
benefit).

3. As a class, create a checklist of criteria for what constitutes a
good political decision. This can be digital or on paper, and students
may wish to tweak it as the activity continues. Make sure to keep this
posted in a visible location.

4. Distribute a copy of the handout [Making a good political
decision](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20F%20-%20Group%20handout%20Making%20a%20good%20political%20decision.pdf "Opens in a new tab") to each group.

***Teacher Tip:** The group handout has space for five criteria.
Students may select the five from the class list they prefer, or the
class can narrow down to five that on which most students agree.*

5. Tell students that they will now consider a political decision that
needs to be made that affects three electoral districts. Using the
criteria of a political decision they co-created, they will try to make
a good political decision.

***Teacher Tip:** It may or may not have emerged from previous lessons
that a key feature of democracy is that sometimes there are winners and
sometimes there are losers when decisions are made. Members of a
democracy compromise and recognize that sometimes their needs are
sacrificed when a decision is made. *

6. Distribute copies of [Electoral district
profiles](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20E%20-%20Student%20handout%20Electoral%20district%20profiles.pdf "Opens in a new tab") for the following provincial
ridings to each group:

a. **Kiiwetinoong**

b. **Parry Sound---Muskoka**

c. **Chatham--Kent---Leamington**

7. In their groups, students will deliberate over where the government
should increase its health funding based on the electoral district
profiles. They can record their thoughts in Part B of the group handout,
[Making a good political
decision](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/curriculum/grade-5-english/5/Appendix%20F%20-%20Group%20handout%20Making%20
