## Financial Statements

All registered political parties, constituency associations, candidates, leadership contestants, and third parties must file financial statements with Elections Ontario.

As a CFO for an Ontario provincial political entity, be aware of the financial filing requirements outlined in the Election Finances Act.

Our Political Financing and Party Information application allows you to find financial statements and publicly disclosable contributions from 2014 onwards.

You can visit our head office to examine registration documents and financial statements filed by registered entities. These documents are physical copies only; there is no electronic search.

Our office hours are Monday to Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM (Eastern Time).

Contact us to order photocopies of financial statements (cost: $1 per page). Payment in advance by cheque or money order is required.
