## How can you make your voice heard?

It is important to know which level of government is responsible for the
different programs and services students will interact with in their
lives. In addition to knowing each government's responsibilities, it is
also important to know which government to contact to get their voices
heard and the ways in which the government acts to get public input. A
key part of democracy is the idea of the common good. Government should
listen to diverse voices because diverse groups have different
perspectives on issues and decisions should be made that are the best
for the whole society. Democracy involves deliberations over how to
balance different interests.
