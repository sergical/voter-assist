# What is democracy?

Democracy means rule by the people and has a long history, originating in Athens hundreds of years ago. There are many democracies around the world. Each has its own voting system, ways of representing citizens, rights and responsibilities. Our Canadian system of government is called a "parliamentary democracy". Understanding the characteristics of democracy and its strengths and weaknesses is an essential component of civic literacy.

**Curriculum connections**:

- **B3.** Understanding Context: demonstrate an understanding of the roles and key responsibilities of citizens and of the different levels of government in Canada, including First Nations, Métis, and Inuit governments.

- **B3.1** describe the major rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship in Canada (e.g. rights: equal protection under the law, freedom of speech,  freedom of religion, the right to vote; responsibilities: to respect the rights of others, to participate in the electoral process and political decision-making,  to improve their communities).

**Learning goals**:

- I am learning to:
  - collaborate with my classmates
  - understand the qualities of a democracy

**Success criteria**:

- I can:
  - explain what a democracy is and is not
  - create a definition of democracy using my own thoughts and those of my classmates
  - assess the ways our school and classroom demonstrate the qualities of a democracy
  - complete an assessment of democracy in my school and classroom with a report card, or choose/create an image that conveys my understanding

**Inquiry question**:

What is democracy?

**Minds on**:

1. Post various images around the classroom that depict aspects of democracy.
2. Students will select an image that best matches their current understanding of democracy and form groups with other students who selected the same image.
3. Each group will write down key ideas the image makes them consider.
4. The teacher will lead a class discussion with each group sharing their thoughts. Key ideas will be recorded prominently.
5. Groups will develop their own definitions of democracy using the shared ideas. These definitions will be posted prominently.
6. The class will work together to come to a consensus on the best definition, after which it will be posted prominently for the remainder of the lesson.

**Activity**:

1. Students will be divided into groups of 3-4 and provided with a handout on democracy and its characteristics.
2. Groups will read the handout and fill in the different sections of a Frayer Model, considering the qualities of democracy.
3. Students will share ideas with the group and record their combined understanding.
4. The class definition of democracy will be reviewed and discussed for revisions.
5. The teacher will create scenarios that help students understand what democracy is.
6. Students will sort the scenarios into categories: "Sounds like a Democracy" and "Does not sound like a Democracy".
7. The teacher will lead a discussion to assess their understanding and students will add to their Frayer Model definitions as they develop their understanding.
8. Students will watch a video on the history of democracy and add points to their Frayer Model handouts.

**Consolidation**:

There are three options for students to consolidate and demonstrate their learning:

- **Option 1: Exit card**
Each student will complete an exit card responding to the lesson inquiry, "What is Democracy?".

- **Option 2: Democracy report card**
Students will evaluate how their classroom and school model the characteristics of a democracy. They will suggest criteria for their evaluation, and will provide a final assessment with a rationale.

- **Option 3: A picture says it all**
Students will select an image or create their own that best exemplifies their understanding of democracy, and will write a brief explanation connecting the image to two characteristics of democracy.

**Assessment**:

The teacher can provide written feedback on one of the three consolidation tasks to communicate to students their understanding of the big ideas. These products can lead to teacher-student conversations about the content they have learned.

**Required materials**:

- Appendix A - Printed material on aspects of democracy
- Appendix B - Student handout on democracy
- Appendix C - Student handout on the Frayer model
- Appendix D - Group handout on democracy and non-democracy
- Appendix E - Student handout on assessment
- Appendix F - Student handout on democracy report card
