# What Do I Think?

## Big Idea

Political perspective is a concept of political thinking. Everyone has different beliefs and values, as do various groups, including different governments, in local, national, and/or global communities. These views can oppose each other and affect how people, groups, and governments act and make decisions.

## Curriculum Connections
