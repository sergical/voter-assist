    eligible individuals voting in provincial, municipal, district
    social services administration board and school board elections

## Sharing of elector information

Elections Ontario is required by law to maintain three registers for
voting in Ontario: the ? **Permanent Register of Electors for
Ontario**](https://www.registertovoteon.ca/register-of-voters), the ? **Register of Absentee
Voters**](https://www.registertovoteon.ca/register-of-absentee-voters) ?  and the ? **Ontario Register of Future
Voters**](https://www.registertovoteon.ca/register-of-future-voters). ? 

Updates are made to the Register on an ongoing basis using information
from federal, provincial and municipal data sources, such as the
National Register of Electors maintained by ? **Elections
Canada**](http://www.elections.ca/), and/or other sources, and through direct
updates from electors, including updates through [**Voter
Registration**](https://vreg.registertovoteon.ca/).

The Chief Electoral Officer of Ontario (CEO) is permitted under
the **Election
Act**](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e06) to provide information from the Register to:

-   the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada; 
-   any municipality in Ontario and its local boards;
-   Members of the Provincial Parliament;
-   registered political parties; and
-   candidates. 

Beginning of January 1, 2024, the **Municipal Elections Act*,
1996**](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/96m32) requires the CEO to provide preliminary
lists of electors derived from the Register to municipal clerks for the
purpose of conducting local electoral events. Pursuant to the **Election
Act**](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90e06), the CEO may also provide information from
the Register to District Social Services Administration Boards and some
school boards to run their board elections in Territories Without
Municipal Organization.

Products**](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2023/policies/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Use%20of%20Electoral%20Products.pdf) explains what information is shared, when it
is shared, how recipients are authorized to use it, and their
responsibilities for safeguarding voter information.

## Redaction of information

The Chief Electoral Officer of Ontario may, on the written request of a
voter and subject to approval, redact from any record made available to
political entities, data partners and to the public, any information
that the Chief Electoral Officer reasonably believes would, if made
available, endanger the life, health or security of the elector.
