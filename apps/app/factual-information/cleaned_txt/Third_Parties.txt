# Third Parties

A third party is any person or entity that is not a political party, candidate, or constituency association, and that engages in political advertising.

If you plan to conduct political advertising during a general election or a by-election in Ontario, you must register with Elections Ontario after incurring expenses of $500 or more on political advertising in either the 12 months before the issue of a writ for a general election (the non-election period) or during an election period.

Third parties register by completing a [Form TP-1 - Third Party Registration and Change Notice](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/politicalentities/Form%20TP-1%20-%20Third%20Party%20Registration%20and%20Change%20Notice%20Form.pdf).

For further information, refer to the [CFO Handbook for Third Parties](https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/Compliance%20Documentation/English/Third%20Party%20Advertisers/CFO%20Handbook%20for%20Third%20Parties.pdf) or [contact us](https://www.elections.on.ca/en/contact-us/contact-information-by-department.html#accordioncontactef).
